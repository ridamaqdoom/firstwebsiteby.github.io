       <h2> <b> Description </b></h2>
        <p> Knowlegde is a familiarity,awerness,or understanding of someone or something, such as fact(propositional knowledge),Skill(procedural knowledge), or objects(aquaintance knowledge).By most accounts,knowlegde can be acquire in many different ways and from many sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony,
             scientific inquiry, education, and practice. The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology.
        </p>

        <p>
            The term knowlegde can refer to a therotical and practical understanding of a subject. It can be implict(as with practical
            skillor expertise) or explict (as with the therotical understanding of a subject); formal or informal;systamatic or practical.
            The philosopher Plato famously pointed out the need for a distinction between knowledge and true belief in the Theaetetus,
            leading many to attriute to him a definition of knowledge as"justified true belief". The difficulties with ths
            defination raised by the Gettier problem have been the subject of extensive debate in epistemology foe more than 
            half a century.

        <h4><b> SELF-KNOWLEDGE </b></h4>
        <p>“Self-knowledge” usually refers to a person's knowledge of their own sensations, thoughts, beliefs, and other mental states.[9] A number of questions regarding self-knowledge have been the subject of extensive debates in philosophy, including whether self-knowledge differs from other types of knowledge, whether we have privileged self-knowledge compared to knowledge of other minds, and the nature of our acquaintance with ourselves.[9] David Hume famously expressed skepticism about whether we could ever have self-knowledge over and above our immediate awareness of a "bundle of perceptions", which was part of his broader skepticism about personal identity.[9] </p>
